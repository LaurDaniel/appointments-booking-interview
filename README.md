# Appointments Booking small app

An small Laravel web-application for appointments booking with both, admin and user views.

Admin user can view all the appointments in the dashboard page and also make appointments in the appointments page (This feature don't really make's sense for this type of user, but it can be used to fully book a date for a day off 🤷🏻‍♂️).

Standard user can view his own appointments and make new appointments, on the same pages as Admin (with a small difference about the dashboard).

# Installation

The installation process should be simple. You only have to:

1)Clone repo

2)Make env file

3)Install Composer dependencies

4)Install node modules and build

5)Migrate database and seed for the admin account

6)Login as admin with email: admin@admin.com, password: password or register a new user
